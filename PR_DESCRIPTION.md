# User Profiles, Favorites & Community Reports

This PR adds three major features to temps.rocks: anonymous user profiles with sync codes, favorite crags, and community condition reports. All features work offline-first and sync across devices.

## 🎯 Overview

### 1. **User Profiles with Sync Codes**
- Anonymous by default - no accounts required
- UUID v4 sync keys for identity across devices
- QR code generation for easy device pairing
- Optional display names for community engagement
- SHA-256 hashed sync keys for privacy

### 2. **Favorite Crags**
- Star button on every conditions card
- Favorites dialog to view and manage saved locations
- Cached conditions (rating, friction score) for quick reference
- Offline-first with localStorage, database-ready for sync

### 3. **Community Condition Reports**
- Submit real-time condition reports (dryness, wind, crowds + text)
- View reports from other climbers in details dialog
- Confirm helpful reports (thumbs up)
- Reports tied to crags in database - everyone sees same reports for a location

## ✨ Key Features

### User Profiles
- **Sync Key Management**: Auto-generated UUID v4 keys stored in localStorage

- **Display Names**: Optional names shown on reports and confirmations
- **Privacy-First**: Sync keys are hashed (SHA-256) before database storage
- **User Menu**: Avatar dropdown in header with quick access to favorites, settings

### Favorites
- **Quick Access**: Star icon on every conditions card
- **Favorites Dialog**: View all saved crags with cached conditions
- **Last Checked**: Timestamps for when conditions were last fetched

### Community Reports
- **Rating Sliders**: Dryness (1-5), Wind (1-5), Crowds (1-5)
- **Text Comments**: Optional 500-char descriptions
- **Author Attribution**: Reports show display name or "Anonymous"

## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
**New Tables:**
- `user_favorites` - Favorite crags with cached conditions
- `user_stats` - Track reports, confirmations, favorites count
- Enhanced `reports` queries to include author info and confirmation counts

**New Migrations:**
- `20251027000000_add_user_favorites.sql` - Favorites and stats tables

### Components Added

### Utilities Added
```
src/lib/
├── auth/sync-key.ts          # Sync key generation, hashing, storage
└── storage/favorites.ts      # Favorites localStorage utilities
```

### Database Queries
```typescript
// Crag matching
findCragByCoordinates()      // Find crag within ~100m
findOrCreateCrag()           // Ensure crags exist for reports

// Favorites
createFavorite()
fetchFavoritesByUserProfile()
checkIsFavorite()
removeFavoriteByArea()

// User stats
fetchOrCreateUserStats()
updateUserStats()
incrementUserStat()
```

### API Changes
**Chat API** (`/api/chat/route.ts`):
- Returns `cragId` with all condition responses
- Calls `findOrCreateCrag()` to ensure crags exist in database
- Enables reports to be tied to database entities
